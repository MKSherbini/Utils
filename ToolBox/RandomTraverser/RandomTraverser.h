/******************************************************************
This class enables you to visit each and every member of an array
exactly once in an apparently random order.

An application of this algorithim would be a good pixel fade in/fade out
where each pixel of the frame buffer was set to black one at a time.

Here's how you would implement a pixel fade using this class:

void FadeToBlack(Screen *screen)
{
	int w = screen.GetWidth();
	int h = screen.GetHeight();

	int pixels = w * h;

	RandomTraverser search(pixels);

	int p;

	while((p=search.GetNext())!=-1)
	{
		int x = p % w;
		int y = h / p;

		screen.SetPixel(x, y, BLACK);

		// of course, you wouldn't blit every pixel change.
		screen.Blit();
	}
}


NOTE: If you want the search to start over at the beginning again - 
you must call the Restart() method, OR call GetNext(true).
